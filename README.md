## Requirements and Installation

To install and run the bot locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sebana02/Sparky.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sparky
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   - `@discord-player/extractor`: Library for music command extraction.
   - `discord-player`: Main library for handling music commands.
   - `discord-player-youtubei`: Extractor specifically for YouTube music.
   - `discord.js`: Wrapper for interacting with the Discord API.
   - `dotenv`: Library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
   - `mediaplex`: Encoder for Opus packets used in voice channels.
   - `module-alias`: Allows setting up module path aliases, aiding in code organization and intellisense.

   ```bash
   npm install @discord-player/extractor discord-player discord-player-youtubei discord.js dotenv mediaplex module-alias
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following information:

   ```bash
   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ```

   You can configure other settings in the `.env` file as well, check the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

6. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

7. Or else start the bot in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the bot with `nodemon` package and will automatically restart the bot when changes are made. In order to stop the bot and exit the process, press `Ctrl + C` twice. To install `nodemon` package, run:

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodemon
   ```

8. The bot should now be running and connected to your Discord server!

## Configuration

### `.env file`

The bot has the following configurations through the `.env` file:

- `TOKEN`: The Discord authentication token. Required for the bot to connect to Discord.
- `LOG_FILE`: The file where logs will be stored. If not specified, logs will be stored in .log file
- `GUILD_ID`: The ID of the server where the bot will be used. If not specified, the bot will register commands globally, which can take up to an hour to be available.
- `PLAYING_ACTIVITY`: The activity status of the bot. If left empty, the bot will not display any activity status.
- `TENOR_API_KEY`: The API key for the Tenor GIF API. Required for GIF commands, you can get one [here](https://tenor.com/developer/keysignup).
- `DJ_ROLE`: The role that will have DJ permissions. If specified, only users with this role will be able to control the music bot.

A template `.env` file is provided in the repository as [`template.env`](templates/template.env).

### `Create a new command`

Any new command must be created in the `commands` folder as it is the path where the bot will look for commands. Inside the folder, any substructure can be followed, as the bot will search for commands recursively, although it is recommended to create a folder for each category of commands.

`Commands` must be `.js` files and must export an object with the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the command. This is the name that will be used to call the command.
- `description`: A brief description of what the command does.
- `permissions` **(optional)**: Permissions required to use the command. If not specified, the command can be used by anyone.
- `voiceChannel` **(optional)**: A boolean indicating if the command can only be used by users connected to a voice channel.
- `options` **(optional)**: An array of options for the command.
- `run (client,inter) => { }`: The function that will be executed when the command is called. It receives the `client` object and the `interaction` object as parameters.

A template command is provided in the repository as [`command.js`](templates/command.js), which have more details about the command structure and can be used as a base for new commands.

### `Create a new event`

Any event must be placed in the `events` folder, specifically in the emmiter's folder it belongs to. The bot will look for events and will automatically register them.

`Events` must be `.js` files and must export an object with the following parameters:

- `event`: The name of the event. This name must correspond to any of the list of events provided by the emitter it belongs to.
- `callback (client, args) => { }`: The function that will be executed when the event is emitted. It receives the `client` object and any `other parameters` that the event emits. (Look at the emitter's documentation to know which parameters are emitted.)

A template event is provided in the repository as [`event.js`](templates/event.js), which have more details about the event structure and can be used as a base for new events.
