# PROJECT IS BEING UPDATED TO TYPESCRIPT, README IS OUTDATED

Some parts of the project are yet to be translated into TypeScript, and the README is one of them. The project is being updated to TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability. The README will be updated soon to reflect the changes and provide accurate information about the project.

## Requirements and Installation

To install and run the bot locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sebana02/Sparky.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sparky
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following information:

   ```bash
   TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   ```

   You can configure other settings in the `.env` file as well, check the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

6. Start the bot:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

7. Or else start the bot in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the bot in development mode, allowing you to test changes without restarting the bot. Just save the changes, and the bot will automatically reload.

8. The bot should now be running and connected to your Discord server!

9. If you want to shut down the bot just press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the bot is running to send a SIGINT signal to the process.

## Configuration

### `.env file`

The bot has the following configurations through the `.env` file:

- `TOKEN`: The Discord authentication token. Required for the bot to connect to Discord.
- `LOG_FILE`: The file where logs will be stored. If not specified, logs will be stored in **.log** file in the root of the project.
- `LANGUAGE`: The language the bot will use. If not specified, the bot will use the default language (en_US). Take into account that it has to match the name of a folder in the `locales` folder. It is recommend to use `IETF BCP 47` rule for clarity.
- `GUILD_ID`: The ID of the server where the bot will be used. If not specified, the bot will register commands globally, which can take up to an hour to be available.
- `PLAYING_ACTIVITY`: The activity status of the bot. If left empty, the bot will not display any activity status.
- `TENOR_API_KEY`: The API key for the Tenor GIF API. Required for GIF commands, you can get one [here](https://tenor.com/developer/keysignup).
- `DJ_ROLE`: The role ID that will have DJ permissions. If specified, only users with this role will be able to control the music bot.

Here is an example of a `.env` file with all the configurations:

```bash
TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"
LOG_FILE="bot.log"
LANGUAGE="en_US"
GUILD_ID="your_guild_id_here"
PLAYING_ACTIVITY="with Sparky | /help"
TENOR_API_KEY="your_tenor_api_key_here"
DJ_ROLE="your_dj_role_id_here"
```

---

### `Create a new command`

Any new command must be created in the `commands` folder, as this is where the bot will search for commands. The folder structure can be organized as needed, but it is recommended to create a subfolder for each command category.

Each command must be a `.ts` file and must export an [`ICommand`](src/interfaces/command.interface.ts) object with the following properties:

- **`data`** _([`SlashCommandBuilder`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/builders/main/class/SlashCommandBuilder))_:  
  The Discord command.

- **`voiceChannel`** _(optional, boolean, default: `false`)_:  
  Indicates whether the command requires the user to be in a voice channel.

- **`blockedInDMs`** _(optional, boolean, default: `false`)_:  
  Indicates whether the command is blocked in DMs.

- **`execute(`[`client`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/Client)`,`[`interaction`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/ChatInputCommandInteraction)`, ...args)`** _(async function)_:  
  The function executed when the command is invoked

Here is a basic command that replies with a greeting:

```typescript
import { ICommand } from '../../interfaces/command.interface.js';
import { ChatInputCommandInteraction, Client, SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js';

export const command: ICommand = {
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('greetings').setDescription('Greets the user'),

  voiceChannel: false,
  blockedInDMs: false,

  execute: async (client: Client, inter: ChatInputCommandInteraction): Promise<void> => {
    await inter.reply('Hello! How can I help you today?');
  },
};
```

---

### `Create a new event`

Any new events must be created in the `events` folder as it is the path where the bot will look for events. Inside the folder, any substructure can be followed, as the bot will search for events recursively, although it is recommended to create a folder for each category of events.

'Events' must be `.ts` files and must export a [IEvent](src/interfaces/event.interface.ts) object with the following parameters:

- **`name`** _(string)_:  
  The name of the event to listen to. It must match the name of the event emitted by the emitter (see documentation for each emitter).

- **`emitter`** _(Emitter)_:  
  The emitter of the event. It can take values from the `Emitter` enum, which is in the same file as the `IEvent` interface. The possible values are:

  - `Process`: Corresponds to the [`Node process`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process-events).
  - `Client`: Corresponds to the [`Discord client`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client).
  - `Music`: Corresponds to the [`Discord player library`](https://discord-player.js.org/docs/discord-player/type/GuildQueueEvents).

- **`execute(`[`client`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/Client)`, ...args)`** _(async function)_:  
  The function executed when the event is triggered.

Here is a basic example of an event that logs when the bot is ready:

```typescript
import { IEvent } from '../../interfaces/event.interface.js';
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

export const event: IEvent = {
  name: 'ready',
  execute: async (client: Client): Promise<void> => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
  },
};
```

## Commands

The bot has a series of callbacks that are executed when certain events occur. These events are located in the `events` folder and are divided into emitters. Each emitter has a series of events that can be listened to. The bot will automatically register these events when the bot starts. The events are divided into the following emitters:

### `Client`

These events are emitted by the Discord client and are related to the bot's connection and status.
